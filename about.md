As of now, I am a programmer with experience in web-based application development and big data-based technologies. I currently work as a software engineer on the digital team at Nordstrom.com. I'm passionate about teaching and furthering this field. I feel it's important that knowledge and code both be shared and open-source to continue the progressive movement of the tech industry. My largest passion I have within this field is distilling complex ideas and theories into simple to digest material for viewers all around the world.
