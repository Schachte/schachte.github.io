<p class="site-intro">Hello, my name is <font size="4.5em"><code>Ryan Schachte</code></font>. I am an <span class="underline"><a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/3934827" target="_blank">avid runner</a></span>,
<span class="underline"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ckjBtm9SBV7JAjbELiBqQ" target="_blank">video blogger</a></span>, <span class="underline"><a href="https://github.com/schachte" target="_blank">software engineer</a></span>, <i>cognitive</i> science enthusiast and prolific reader. I've recently
graduated with my Master's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University in 2017.

<p>I've been extremely passionate about computers, programming and technology since the young age of 12 years old having developed some of my first websites and blogs.
I love getting pulled into the complexities of software development, problem solving &amp; mathematics, which sparked my interest into this field as a career. 

<p>Having shifted into a field that requires much discipline and patience, I began to study cognitive science as a side-hobby, specifically
parts of the brain dealing with productivity and focus. Some of my favorite books that inspired me early on: <i><a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/"><span class="underline">Power of Habit</span></a>, <a href="http://alifeofproductivity.com/book/"><span class="underline">The Productivity Project</span></a>, <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"><span class="underline">Deep Work</span></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322"><span class="underline">Mindset: The Psychology of Success</span></a></i>. Learning is truly one of my greatest passions, which can be equally balance with

<p class="site-intro">I currently work at <span class="underline">Connexta</span>
as a software engineer and team lead. Previously, I was at <span class="underline">ExxonMobil</span>, <span class="underline">Allstate Labs</span>, <span class="underline">IBM</span>, <span class="underline">Simplewan</span> and <span class="underline">Intel Corp</span>. <span class="underline"><a href="/Ryan_Schachte_Resume.pdf">   View the rest of my resume here.</a></span>
